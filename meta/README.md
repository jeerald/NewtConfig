# NewtConfig

## Overview

NewtConfig is a simple mod which allows you to adjust how often Newt Altars and blue (bazaar) portals appear, as well as a few other related details. Spawn a bazaar portal after every stage, disable the guaranteed Newt Altars on stages that have them, or prevent access to the bazaar entirely. All options are explained and controlled via the config file.

## Installation

If you have R2modman installed, click "Install with Mod Manager" above or install through the R2modman mod browser. To install manually, ensure you have installed the latest BepInEx, then extract NewtConfig.dll to `Risk of Rain 2\BepInEx\plugins`.

## Issues

Newt Altar spawn chance is not networked correctly. The host may not see the same altars as non-hosts.
